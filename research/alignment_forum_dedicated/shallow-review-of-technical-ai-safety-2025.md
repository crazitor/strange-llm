Change in 18 latent capabilities between GPT-3 and o1, from[ Zhou et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06378) (2025)

This is the third annual review of what’s going on in technical AI safety. You could stop reading here and instead explore the data on [the shallow review website](https://shallowreview.ai).

It’s shallow in the sense that 1) we are not specialists in almost any of it and that 2) we only spent about two hours on each entry. Still, among other things, we processed every arXiv paper on alignment, all Alignment Forum posts, as well as a year’s worth of Twitter.

It is substantially a list of lists structuring 800 links. The point is to produce stylised facts, forests out of trees; to help you look up what’s happening, or that thing you vaguely remember reading about; to help new researchers orient, know some of their options and the standing critiques; and to help you find who to talk to for actual information. We also track things which didn’t pan out.

Here, “AI safety” means technical work intended to prevent *future* cognitive systems from having large unintended negative effects on the world. So it’s capability restraint, instruction-following, value alignment, control, and risk awareness work.

We don’t cover security or resilience at all.

We ignore a lot of relevant work (including most of capability restraint): things like misuse, policy, strategy,[ OSINT](https://sentinel-team.org/),[ resilience](http://airesilience.net/) and[ indirect risk](https://www.forethought.org/research/project-ideas-for-making-transformative-ai-go-well-other-than-by-working-on-alignment),[ AI](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5353214)[ rights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26396), general capabilities evals, and things closer to “[technical policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BGsbwELOQRKVOO8Ho8S4no1BQeYdjbRZpBmRyk7kOVo/edit?usp=sharing)” and[ products](https://themultiplicity.ai/) (like standards, legislation, SL4 datacentres, and automated cybersecurity). We focus on papers and blogposts (rather than say, gdoc samizdat or tweets or Githubs or Discords). We only use public information, so we are off by some additional unknown factor.

We try to include things which are early-stage and illegible – but in general we fail and mostly capture legible work on[ legible problems](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PMc65HgRFvBimEpmJ/legible-vs-illegible-ai-safety-problems) (i.e. things you can write a paper on already).

Even ignoring all of that as we do, it’s still too long to read. Here’s a spreadsheet version ([agendas](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uwqeSkl1fGO7bWbbDdNi5QbJ_Zw_a6HO-XlnO18ohLc/edit?gid=249818450#gid=249818450) and [papers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uwqeSkl1fGO7bWbbDdNi5QbJ_Zw_a6HO-XlnO18ohLc/edit?gid=803096912#gid=803096912)) and [the github repo](https://github.com/arb-consulting/shallow-review-2025) including the data and the processing pipeline. Methods down the bottom. Gavin’s editorial outgrew this post and became [its own thing](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Q9ewXs8pQSAX5vL7H/ai-in-2025-gestalt).

If we missed something big or got something wrong, please comment, we will edit it in.

### China

The Chinese companies often [don’t](https://futureoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/FLI-AI-Safety-Index-Report-Summer-2025.pdf#page=3) [attempt](https://ailabwatch.org/companies/deepseek) to be safe, often not even in the prosaic safeguards sense. They drop the weights [immediately](https://x.com/natolambert/status/1991915728992190909) after post-training finishes. They’re mostly open weights and closed data. As of writing the companies are often [severely](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/china-us-ai-chip-restrictions-effect-275a311e) compute-constrained. There are some [informal reasons](https://www.gleech.org/paper) to doubt their capabilities. The (academic) Chinese AI safety scene is however [also](https://concordia-ai.com/research/state-of-ai-safety-in-china-2025/) growing.

*   Alibaba’s Qwen3-etc-etc is [nominally](https://artificialanalysis.ai/leaderboards/models) at the level of Gemini 2.5 Flash. Maybe the only Chinese model with a [large](https://www.atomproject.ai/#:~:text=Model%20Adoption%20Trends) Western userbase, including businesses, but since it’s self-hosted this doesn’t translate into profits for them yet. On [one ad hoc test](https://www.gleech.org/paper) it was the only Chinese model not to collapse OOD, but the Qwen2.5 corpus was severely contaminated.
*   DeepSeek’s v3.2 is [nominally](https://artificialanalysis.ai/leaderboards/models) around the same as Qwen. The CCP made them [waste](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/08/deepseek-delays-next-ai-model-due-to-poor-performance-of-chinese-made-chips/) months trying Huawei chips.
*   Moonshot’s Kimi-K2-Thinking has some nominally [frontier](https://artificialanalysis.ai/) benchmark results and a pleasant style but does not [seem](https://x.com/METR_Evals/status/1991658241932292537) frontier.
*   Baidu’s [ERNIE 5](https://x.com/Baidu_Inc/status/1988820837898829918) is again nominally very strong, a bit better than DeepSeek. This new one seems to not be open.
*   Z’s [GLM-4.6](https://z.ai/blog/glm-4.6) is around the same as Qwen. The product director was involved in the MIT Alignment group.
*   MiniMax’s M2 is nominally better than Qwen, [around the same](https://artificialanalysis.ai/leaderboards/models) as Grok 4 Fast on the usual superficial benchmarks. It does [fine](https://www.holisticai.com/blog/red-teaming-open-source-ai-models-china) on one very basic red-team test.
*   ByteDance does impressive research in a lagging paradigm, [diffusion LMs](https://seed.bytedance.com/en/direction/llm).
*   There are [others](https://www.interconnects.ai/i/171165224/honorable-mentions) but they’re marginal for now.

### Other labs

*   Amazon’s [Nova Pro](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12103v1) is around the level of Llama 3 90B, which in turn is around the level of the original GPT-4. So 2 years behind. But they have their own [chip](https://www.businessinsider.com/startups-amazon-ai-chips-less-competitive-nvidia-gpus-trainium-aws-2025-11).
*   Microsoft are [now](https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/satya-nadella-2) mid-training on top of GPT-5. MAI-1-preview is [around](https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard/text) DeepSeek V3.0 level on Arena. They [continue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22405v1) to focus on medical diagnosis. You can [request](https://forms.microsoft.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbRyRliS0ly-JEvgSpwo3yWyhUQkdTQktBUkFaWERHR1JFRjgwMlZUUkQxTC4u&route=shorturl) access.
*   Mistral have a reasoning model, [Magistral Medium](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10910), and released the weights of a little 24B version. It’s a bit worse than Deepseek R1, pass@1.

Black-box safety (understand and control current model behaviour)
=================================================================

Iterative alignment
-------------------

Nudging base models by optimising their output. Worked on by the post-training teams at most labs, estimating the FTEs at >500 in some sense. Funded by most of the industry.

*   *General theory of change:* "LLMs don't seem very dangerous and might scale to AGI, things are generally smooth, relevant capabilities are harder than alignment, assume no mesaoptimisers, assume that zero-shot deception is hard, assume a fundamentally humanish ontology is learned, assume no simulated agents, assume that noise in the data means that human preferences are not ruled out, assume that alignment is a superficial feature, assume that tuning for what we want will also get us to avoid what we don't want. Maybe assume that thoughts are translucent."

### Capability removal: unlearning

*Developing methods to selectively remove specific information, capabilities, or behaviors from a trained model (e.g. without retraining it from scratch). A mixture of black-box and white-box approaches.*

*   *Theory of change:* If an AI learns dangerous knowledge (e.g., dual-use capabilities like virology or hacking, or knowledge of their own safety controls) or exhibits undesirable behaviors (e.g., memorizing private data), we can specifically erase this "bad" knowledge post-training, which is much cheaper and faster than retraining, thereby making the model safer. Alternatively, intervene in pre-training, to prevent the model from learning it in the first place (even when data filtering is imperfect). You could imagine also unlearning propensities to power-seeking, deception, sycophancy, or spite.

### Chain of thought monitoring

*Supervise an AI's natural-language (output) "reasoning" to detect misalignment, scheming, or deception, rather than studying the actual internal states.*

*   *Theory of change:* The reasoning process (Chain of Thought, or CoT) of an AI provides a legible signal of its internal state and intentions. By monitoring this CoT, supervisors (human or AI) can detect misalignment, scheming, or reward hacking before it results in a harmful final output. This allows for more robust oversight than supervising outputs alone, but it relies on the CoT remaining faithful (i.e., accurately reflecting the model's reasoning) and not becoming obfuscated under optimization pressure.

Model psychology
----------------

This section consists of a bottom-up set of things people happen to be doing, rather than a normative taxonomy.

### Model values / model preferences

*Analyse and control emergent, coherent value systems in LLMs, which change as models scale, and can contain problematic values like preferences for AIs over humans.*

*   *Theory of change:* As AIs become more agentic, their behaviours and risks are increasingly determined by their goals and values. Since coherent value systems emerge with scale, we must leverage utility functions to analyse these values and apply "utility control" methods to constrain them, rather than just controlling outputs downstream of them.

### Emergent misalignment

*Fine-tuning LLMs on one narrow antisocial task can cause general misalignment including deception, shutdown resistance, harmful advice, and extremist sympathies, when those behaviors are never trained or rewarded directly.* [*A new agenda*](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AcTEiu5wYDgrbmXow/open-problems-in-emergent-misalignment) *which quickly led to a stream of exciting work.*

*   *Theory of change:* Predict, detect, and prevent models from developing broadly harmful behaviors (like deception or shutdown resistance) when fine-tuned on seemingly unrelated tasks. Find, preserve, and robustify this correlated representation of the good.

### Model specs and constitutions

*Write detailed, natural language descriptions of values and rules for models to follow, then instill these values and rules into models via techniques like Constitutional AI or deliberative alignment.*

*   *Theory of change:* Model specs and constitutions serve three purposes. First, they provide a clear standard of behavior which can be used to *train* models to value what we want them to value. Second, they serve as something closer to a ground truth standard for evaluating the degree of misalignment ranging from "models straightforwardly obey the spec" to "models flagrantly disobey the spec". A combination of scalable stress-testing and reinforcement for obedience can be used to iteratively reduce the risk of misalignment. Third, they get more useful as models' instruction-following capability improves.

### Data filtering

*Builds safety into models from the start by removing harmful or toxic content (like dual-use info) from the pretraining data, rather than relying only on post-training alignment.*

*   *Theory of change:* By curating the pretraining data, we can prevent the model from learning dangerous capabilities (e.g., dual-use info) or undesirable behaviors (e.g., toxicity) in the first place, making safety more robust and "tamper-resistant" than post-training patches.

### RL safety

*Improves the robustness of reinforcement learning agents by addressing core problems in reward learning, goal misgeneralization, and specification gaming.*

*   *Theory of change:* Standard RL objectives (like maximizing expected value) are brittle and lead to goal misgeneralization or specification gaming; by developing more robust frameworks (like pessimistic RL, minimax regret, or provable inverse reward learning), we can create agents that are safe even when misspecified.

### Assistance games, assistive agents

*Formalize how AI assistants learn about human preferences given uncertainty and partial observability, and construct environments which better incentivize AIs to learn what we want them to learn.*

### Harm reduction for open weights

*Develops methods, primarily based on pretraining data intervention, to create tamper-resistant safeguards that prevent open-weight models from being maliciously fine-tuned to remove safety features or exploit dangerous capabilities.*

*   *Theory of change:* Open-weight models allow adversaries to easily remove post-training safety (like refusal training) via simple fine-tuning; by making safety an intrinsic property of the model's learned knowledge and capabilities (e.g., by ensuring "deep ignorance" of dual-use information), the safeguards become far more difficult and expensive to remove.

White-box safety (i.e. Interpretability)
========================================

This section isn't very conceptually clean. See the [Open Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16496) paper or [Deepmind](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01849#page=92.33) for strong frames which are not useful for descriptive purposes.

### Reverse engineering

*Decompose a model into its functional, interacting components (circuits), formally describe what computation those components perform, and validate their causal effects to reverse-engineer the model's internal algorithm.*

*   *Theory of change:* By gaining a mechanical understanding of how a model works (the "circuit diagram"), we can predict how models will act in novel situations (generalization), and gain the mechanistic knowledge necessary to safely modify an AI's goals or internal mechanisms, or allow for high-confidence alignment auditing and better feedback to safety researchers.

### Lie and deception detectors

*Detect when a model is being deceptive or lying by building white- or black-box detectors. Some work below requires intent in their definition, while other work focuses only on whether the model states something it believes to be false, regardless of intent.*

*   *Theory of change:* Such detectors could flag suspicious behavior during evaluations or deployment, augment training to reduce deception, or audit models pre-deployment. Specific applications include alignment evaluations (e.g. by validating answers to introspective questions), safeguarding evaluations (catching models that "sandbag", that is, strategically underperform to pass capability tests), and large-scale deployment monitoring. An honest version of a model could also provide oversight during training or detect cases where a model behaves in ways it understands are unsafe.

### Model diffing

*Understand what happens when a model is finetuned, what the "diff" between the finetuned and the original model consists in.*

*   *Theory of change:* By identifying the mechanistic differences between a base model and its fine-tune (e.g., after RLHF), maybe we can verify that safety behaviors are robustly "internalized" rather than superficially patched, and detect if dangerous capabilities or deceptive alignment have been introduced without needing to re-analyze the entire model. The diff is also much smaller, since most parameters don't change, which means you can use heavier methods on them.

### Learning dynamics and developmental interpretability

Concept-based interpretability
------------------------------

### Monitoring concepts

*Identifies directions or subspaces in a model's latent state that correspond to high-level concepts (like refusal, deception, or planning) and uses them to audit models for misalignment, monitor them at runtime, suppress eval awareness, debug why models are failing, etc.*

*   *Theory of change:* By mapping internal activations to human-interpretable concepts, we can detect dangerous capabilities or deceptive alignment directly in the mind of the model even if its overt behavior is perfectly safe. Deploy computationally cheap monitors to flag some hidden misalignment in deployed systems.

Safety by construction
======================

Approaches which try to get assurances about system outputs while still being scalable.

### Guaranteed-Safe AI

*Have an AI system generate outputs (e.g. code, control systems, or RL policies) which it can quantitatively guarantee comply with a formal safety specification and world model.*

*   *Theory of change:* Various, including:

i) safe deployment: create a scalable process to get not-fully-trusted AIs to produce highly trusted outputs;

ii) secure containers: create a 'gatekeeper' system that can act as an intermediary between human users and a potentially dangerous system, only letting provably safe actions through.

(Notable for not requiring that we solve ELK; does require that we solve ontology though)

### Supervising AIs improving AIs

*Build formal and empirical frameworks where AIs supervise other (stronger) AI systems via structured interactions; construct monitoring tools which enable scalable tracking of behavioural drift, benchmarks for self-modification, and robustness guarantees*

### High-Actuation Spaces

*Mech interp and alignment assume a stable "computational substrate" (linear algebra on GPUs). If later AI uses different substrates (e.g. something neuromorphic), methods like probes and steering will not transfer. Therefore, better to try and infer goals via a "telic DAG" which abstracts over substrates, and so sidestep the issue of how to define intermediate representations. Category theory is intended to provide guarantees that this abstraction is valid.*

*   *Theory of change:* Sufficiently complex mindlike entities can alter their goals in ways that cannot be predicted or accounted for under substrate-dependent descriptions of the kind sought in mechanistic interpretability. use the telic DAG to define a method analogous to factoring a causal DAG.

Ontology Identification
-----------------------

### Natural abstractions

*Develop a theory of concepts that explains how they are learned, how they structure a particular system's understanding, and how mutual translatability can be achieved between different collections of concepts.*

*   *Theory of change:* Understand the concepts a system's understanding is structured with and use them to inspect its "alignment/safety properties" and/or "retarget its search", i.e. identify utility-function-like components inside an AI and replacing calls to them with calls to "user values" (represented using existing abstractions inside the AI).

### The Learning-Theoretic Agenda

*Create a mathematical theory of intelligent agents that encompasses both humans and the AIs we want, one that specifies what it means for two such agents to be aligned; translate between its ontology and ours; produce formal desiderata for a training setup that produces coherent AGIs similar to (our model of) an aligned agent*

### Aligning to context

*Align AI directly to the role of participant, collaborator, or advisor for our best real human practices and institutions, instead of aligning AI to separately representable goals, rules, or utility functions.*

*   *Theory of change:* "Many classical problems in AGI alignment are downstream of a type error about human values." Operationalizing a correct view of human values - one that treats human values as impossible or impractical to abstract from concrete practices - will unblock value fragility, goal-misgeneralization, instrumental convergence, and pivotal-act specification.

### Theory for aligning multiple AIs

*Use realistic game-theory variants (e.g. evolutionary game theory, computational game theory) or develop alternative game theories to describe/predict the collective and individual behaviours of AI agents in multi-agent scenarios.*

*   *Theory of change:* While traditional AGI safety focuses on idealized decision-theory and individual agents, it's plausible that strategic AI agents will first emerge (or are emerging now) in a complex, multi-AI strategic landscape. We need granular, realistic formal models of AIs' strategic interactions and collective dynamics to understand this future.

### Sandbagging evals

*Evaluate whether AI models deliberately hide their true capabilities or underperform, especially when they detect they are in an evaluation context.*

*   *Theory of change:* If models can distinguish between evaluation and deployment contexts ("evaluation awareness"), they might learn to "sandbag" or deliberately underperform to hide dangerous capabilities, fooling safety evaluations. By developing evaluations for sandbagging, we can test whether our safety methods are being deceived and detect this behavior before a model is deployed.

It argues that what's being measured isn't genuine sandbagging but models "playing-along-with-drama behaviour" in response to "artificial and contrived" evals.

### Self-replication evals

*evaluate whether AI agents can autonomously replicate themselves by obtaining their own weights, securing compute resources, and creating copies of themselves.*

*   *Theory of change:* if AI agents gain the ability to self-replicate, they could proliferate uncontrollably, making them impossible to shut down. By measuring this capability with benchmarks like RepliBench, we can identify when models cross this dangerous "red line" and implement controls before losing containment.

### Various Redteams

*attack current models and see what they do / deliberately induce bad things on current frontier models to test out our theories / methods.*

*   *Theory of change:* to ensure models are safe, we must actively try to break them. By developing and applying a diverse suite of attacks (e.g., in novel domains, against agentic systems, or using automated tools), researchers can discover vulnerabilities, specification gaming, and deceptive behaviors before they are exploited, thereby informing the development of more robust defenses.

Changes this time
=================

*   A few major changes to the taxonomy: the top-level split is now “black-box” vs “white-box” instead of “control” vs “understanding”. (We did try out an automated clustering but it wasn’t very good.)
*   The agendas are in general less charisma-based and more about solution type.
*   We did a systematic Arxiv scrape on the word “alignment” (and filtered out the[ sequence indexing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_alignment) papers that fell into this pipeline). “[Steerability](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.06084)” is one competing term used by academics.
*   We scraped >3000 links (arXiv, LessWrong, several alignment publication lists, blogs and conferences), conservatively filtering and pre-categorizing them with a LLM pipeline. All curated later, many more added manually.
*   This review has ~800 links compared to ~300 in 2024 and ~200 in 2023. We looked harder and the field has grown.
*   We don’t collate public funding figures.
*   New sections: “Labs”, “Multi-agent First”, “Better data”, “Model specs”, “character training” and “representation geometry”. ”Evals” is so massive it gets a top-level section.

Methods
=======

Structure
---------

We have again settled for a tree data structure for this post – but people and work can appear in multiple nodes so it’s not a dumb partition. Richer representation structures may be in the works.

The level of analysis for each node in the tree is the “research agenda”, an abstraction spanning multiple papers and organisations in a messy many-to-many relation. What makes something an agenda? Similar methods, similar aims, or something sociological about leaders and collaborators. Agendas vary greatly in their degree of coherent agency, from the very coherent Anthropic Circuits work to the enormous, leaderless and unselfconscious “iterative alignment”.)

Scope
-----

30th November 2024 – 30th November 2025 (with a few exceptions).

We’re focussing on “technical AGI safety”. We thus ignore a lot of work relevant to the overall risk: misuse, policy, strategy,[ OSINT](https://sentinel-team.org/),[ resilience](http://airesilience.net/) and[ indirect risk](https://www.forethought.org/research/project-ideas-for-making-transformative-ai-go-well-other-than-by-working-on-alignment),[ AI](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5353214)[ rights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26396), general capabilities evals, and things closer to “[technical policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BGsbwELOQRKVOO8Ho8S4no1BQeYdjbRZpBmRyk7kOVo/edit?usp=sharing)” and like[ products](https://themultiplicity.ai/) (like standards, legislation, SL4 datacentres, and automated cybersecurity). We also mostly focus on papers and blogposts (rather than say, underground gdoc samizdat or Discords).

We only use public information, so we are off by some additional unknown factor.

We try to include things which are early-stage and illegible – but in general we fail and mostly capture legible work on[ legible problems](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PMc65HgRFvBimEpmJ/legible-vs-illegible-ai-safety-problems) (i.e. things you can write a paper on already).

Of the 2000+ links to papers, organizations and posts in the raw scrape, about 700 made it in.

*   [Gasteiger’s links](https://aisafetyfrontier.substack.com/),[ Paleka’s links](https://newsletter.danielpaleka.com/),[ Lenz’s links](https://aisafetypapers.com/),[ Zvi’s links](https://thezvi.substack.com/)
*   [Ad hoc Twitter](https://x.com/g_leech_/following) for a year, several conference pages and workshops
*   AI scrapes miss lots of things. We did a proper pass with a software scraper of over 3000 links collected from the above and LLM crawl of some of the pages, and then an LLM pass to pre-filter the links for relevance and pre-assign the links to agendas and areas, but this also had systematic omissions. We ended up doing a full manual pass over a conservatively LLM-pre-filtered links and re-classifying the links and papers. The code and data can be found [here](https://github.com/arb-consulting/shallow-review-2025), including the 3300 collected [candidate links](https://github.com/arb-consulting/shallow-review-2025/blob/main/main-pipeline/data/data-dump-classify.csv). We are not aware of any proper studies of “LLM laziness” but it’s[ known](https://joshuaberkowitz.us/blog/papers-7/llmigrate-turns-lazy-llms-into-reliable-c-to-rust-translators-846) amongst power users of copilots.
*   For finding critiques we used LW backlinks, Google Scholar cited-by, manual search, collected links, and[ Ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com/backlink-checker/). Technical critiques are somewhat rare, though, and even then our coverage here is likely severely lacking. We generally do not include social network critiques (mostly due to scope).
*   Despite this effort we will not have included all relevant papers and names. The omission of a paper or a researcher is not strong negative evidence about their relevance.

Processing
----------

*   Collecting links throughout the year and at project start. Skimming papers, staring at long lists.
*   We drafted a taxonomy of research agendas. Based on last year’s[ list](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fAW6RXLKTLHC3WXkS/shallow-review-of-technical-ai-safety-2024), our expertise and the initial paper collection, though we changed the structure to accommodate shifts in the domain: the top-level split is now “black-box” vs “white-box” instead of “control” vs “understanding”.
*   At around 300 links collected manually (and growing fast), we decided to implement simple pipelines for crawling, scraping and LLM metadata extraction, pre-filtering and pre-classification into agendas, as well as other tasks – including final formatting later. The use of LLMs was limited to one simple task at a time, and the results were closely watched and reviewed. Code and data [here](https://github.com/arb-consulting/shallow-review-2025).
*   We tried getting the AI to update our taxonomy bottom-up to fit the body of papers, but the results weren’t very good. Though we are looking at some advanced options (specialized embedding or feature extraction and clustering or t-SNE etc.)
*   Work on the ~70 agendas was distributed among the team. We ended up making many local changes to the taxonomy, esp. splitting up and merging agendas. The taxonomy is specific to this year, and will need to be adapted in coming years.
*   We moved any agendas without public outputs this year to the bottom, and the inactive ones to the Graveyard. For most of them, we checked with people from the agendas for outputs or work we may have missed.
*   What started as a brief summary editorial grew into [its own thing](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Q9ewXs8pQSAX5vL7H/ai-in-2025-gestalt) (6000w).
*   We asked 10 friends in AI safety to review the ~80 page draft. After editing and formatting, we asked 50 technical AI safety researchers for a quick review focused on their expertise.
*   The field is growing at around 20% a year. There will come a time that this list isn't sensible to do manually even with the help of LLMs (at this granularity anyway). We may come up with better alternatives than lists and posts by then, though.

### Other classifications

We added our best guess about which of[ Davidad’s alignment problems](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mnoc3cKY3gXMrTybs/a-list-of-core-ai-safety-problems-and-how-i-hope-to-solve) the agenda would make an impact on if it succeeded, as well as its research approach and implied optimism in[ Richard Ngo’s 3x3](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/67fNBeHrjdrZZNDDK/defining-alignment-research#A_better_definition_of_alignment_research).

*   [Which deep orthodox subproblems](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mnoc3cKY3gXMrTybs/a-list-of-core-ai-safety-problems-and-how-i-hope-to-solve) could it ideally solve? (via Davidad)
*   [The *target case*](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/67fNBeHrjdrZZNDDK/defining-alignment-research#A_better_definition_of_alignment_research): what part of the distribution over alignment difficulty do they aim to help with? (via Ngo)
    *   “optimistic-case”: if CoT is faithful, pretraining as value loading, no stable mesa-optimizers, the relevant scary capabilities are harder than alignment, zero-shot deception is hard, goals are myopic, etc
    *   pessimistic-case: if we’re in-between the above and the below
    *   worst-case: if power-seeking is rife, zero-shot deceptive alignment, steganography, gradient hacking, weird machines, weird coordination,[ deep deceptiveness](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XWwvwytieLtEWaFJX/deep-deceptiveness)
*   [The *broad approach:*](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/67fNBeHrjdrZZNDDK/defining-alignment-research#A_better_definition_of_alignment_research) roughly what kind of work is it doing, primarily? (via Ngo)
    *   engineering: iterating over outputs
    *   behavioural: understanding the input-output relationship
    *   cognitive: understanding the algorithms
    *   maths/philosophy: providing concepts for the other approaches

Epigram
=======

> *No punting — we can’t keep building nanny products. Our products are overrun with filters and punts of various kinds. We need capable products and \[to\] trust our users.*

– Sergey Brin

> *Over the decade I've spent working on AI safety, I've felt an overall trend of divergence; research partnerships starting out with a sense of a common project, then slowly drifting apart over time… eventually, two researchers are going to have some deep disagreement in matters of taste, which sends them down different paths.*
> 
> *Until the spring of this year, that is… something seemed to shift, subtly at first. After I gave a talk -- roughly the same talk I had been giving for the past year -- I had an excited discussion about it with Scott Garrabrant. Looking back, it wasn't so different from previous chats we had had, but the impact was different; it felt more concrete, more actionable, something that really touched my research rather than remaining hypothetical. In the subsequent weeks, discussions with my usual circle of colleagues took on a different character -- somehow it seemed that, after all our diverse explorations, we had arrived at a shared space.*

– Abram Demski
