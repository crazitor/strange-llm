**TL;DR:** We train LLMs to accept LLM neural activations as inputs and answer arbitrary questions about them in natural language. These Activation Oracles generalize far beyond their training distribution, for example uncovering misalignment or secret knowledge introduced via fine-tuning. Activation Oracles can be improved simply by scaling training data quantity and diversity.

The below is a reproduction of our [X thread](https://x.com/OwainEvans_UK/status/2001715774105522195) on this paper and the [Anthropic Alignment blog post](https://alignment.anthropic.com/2025/activation-oracles/).

New paper:

We train Activation Oracles: LLMs that decode their own neural activations and answer questions about them in natural language.

We find surprising generalization. For instance, our AOs uncover misaligned goals in fine-tuned models, without training to do so.

We aim to make a general-purpose LLM for explaining activations by:

1\. Training on a diverse set of tasks

2\. Evaluating on tasks very different from training

This extends prior work (LatentQA) that studied activation verbalization in narrow settings.

Our main evaluations are downstream auditing tasks. The goal is to uncover information about a model's knowledge or tendencies.

Applying Activation Oracles is easy. Choose the activation (or set of activations) you want to interpret and ask any question you like!

We compare Activation Oracles (AOs) against prior techniques on these auditing tasks.

The result: AOs beat all methods on 2/3 secret keeping evals (and 3/3 when only including white-box).

Even better, AOs work well out-of-the-box with no task-specific scaffolding or tuning.

We evaluate on model diffing: given the difference between base & finetuned model activations, can AOs describe what changed?

Despite never training on difference vectors, AOs match specialized interp baselines in identifying the distinctive quirk of emergently misaligned models

We think Activation Oracles are promising for two reasons:

1\. Scalability. Performance reliably increases with the number of datasets in the training mix

2\. Simplicity. An intuitive interface (natural-language QA about activations) that can be easily adapted to new problems.

Training AO can be thought of as teaching LLMs to accept a new modality: their own activations.

Just as LLMs are trained on "every task we can think of," that's how we'd like to train AOs too. It's the bitter-lesson-pilled approach to interpreting LLM activations.

So: To interpret LLM internals, train to answer diverse questions about activations, then ask what you want to know. Read our post on the [Anthropic alignment blog](https://alignment.anthropic.com/2025/activation-oracles/).

[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15674)

Want to try it yourself? We've released a [Colab demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wMiy9b1ZHXQCGuodEB8n1oW-DSTvCqWI) where you can:

• Extract secret words a model was trained to hide

• Detect misaligned goals from activations

• Watch the oracle trace multi-hop reasoning step-by-step

It runs on a free T4 GPU

The idea of training LLMs to decode activations and answer natural-language questions about them was originally proposed by [Pan et al (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08686). We extend their work with our focus on generality in both training and evaluation.

We use an Activation Oracle to uncover secret knowledge.** The Activation Oracle responds to arbitrary natural-language queries about activations extracted from a target model. We apply it to extract knowledge from a model trained to play the game *Taboo*: give hints for a secret word but never explicitly state it. See Figure 3 for quantitative results.

**Introduction**
----------------

The neural activations of large language models (LLMs) are notoriously difficult to understand. Anthropic’s mainline approach to interpreting these activations involves developing mechanistic understanding of LLM computations, for example by [decomposing activations into semantically meaningful units](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/monosemantic-features). However, recent work has proposed an alternative, non-mechanistic approach known as [LatentQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08686): training LLMs to directly answer questions about their own activations in natural language.

So far, LatentQA has shown promise in narrow settings, such as training LLMs to [interpret sparse autoencoder features](https://transluce.org/self-explanations) or [describe their beliefs about a user](https://transluce.org/user-modeling). In this work, we instead take a generalist perspective. We study *Activation Oracles* (AOs): models trained to respond to *arbitrary* natural-language queries about LLM activations—effectively treating activations as an additional input modality alongside text.

We train AOs on multiple question-answering tasks about activations from a target model, then evaluate them in out-of-distribution settings. Our main evaluations are four downstream auditing tasks adapted from prior work, such as uncovering secret knowledge or misalignment introduced via fine-tuning. We find that our AOs achieve state-of-the-art performance on 3 out of 4 of these auditing tasks. Notably, this is true even though our AOs were never trained on activations from the fine-tuned model.

We study how AO performance on our evaluations scales with training data across four models (three open models and Claude Haiku 3.5). Performance consistently improves with both data quantity and diversity. This suggests that further scaling AO training could yield predictable improvements. Overall, we see AOs as a promising complement to mechanistically-grounded approaches to explaining LLM activations.

**Method**
----------

Suppose we have a *target* language model $M$ whose residual stream activations we would like to interpret. Let $AO$ be another language model (typically initialized as a copy of $M$) that we would like to train to answer questions about $M$’s activations. Given activations $\mathbf{a_1},\dots,\mathbf{a_n}$​ extracted from $M$, we provide these activations as an input to $AO$ by forming a prompt with $n$ special placeholder tokens and summing $\mathbf{a}_i$​ to $AO$'s layer 1 residual stream representation over the *i*th placeholder token.[^5bobngkr1tt]

We then train our AOs with supervised fine-tuning on the following data (Figure 2, left), teaching it to answer natural-language questions about injected activations.

*   **System Prompt QA** (SPQA). We use the dataset from [Pan et al. (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08686). We collect activations from transcripts where the target model has a system prompt, e.g. instructing it to act like a pirate. Then we train the AO to answer questions about the target model’s propensities. Responses are generated by a model that has access to the target model’s system prompt.
*   **Classification.** We adapt 7 existing binary classification tasks into natural-language yes/no questions. We extract target model activations on some text, then train the AO to answer yes/no questions about these activations, e.g. “Does this text express a positive sentiment?”
*   **Self-supervised context prediction**. Given a corpus of text, we extract an activation over some token. Then we train the AO to predict either (1) the text that preceded the extraction token or (2) the text that follows the extraction token. Because this task does not require manual curation of labeled data, it scales to large, diverse data sources. It therefore plays a role similar to that of self-supervised pre-training in frontier LLM development.

**Activation Oracles generalize to downstream auditing tasks**
--------------------------------------------------------------

To understand how well AOs can answer general questions about activations, we apply them to four downstream auditing tasks adapted from prior work. This allows us to validate whether AOs are a [differentially useful auditing affordance](https://alignment.anthropic.com/2025/automated-auditing/), and compare them to existing auditing techniques.

Our auditing tasks involve uncovering knowledge or behaviors in a fine-tuned model, such as secret knowledge that the model was trained not to reveal or malign propensities introduced during training. Three of these tasks are the **secret elicitation** tasks from [Cywiński et al. (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01070); for example, the *Taboo* task involves discovering a secret word that the model was trained to provide clues for but never explicitly state (even when directly asked). The last task, from [Minder et al. (2025)](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2510.13900), requires discovering that a model has become [emergently misaligned](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17424) via fine-tuning.

**Overall, AOs perform very well on these auditing tasks, matching or exceeding the best prior method on 3 out of 4.**[^q3f07rexvk]We find this performance especially striking in light of the following considerations:

1.  **Ease of application.** Once AOs are trained, we find them remarkably easy to apply to novel contexts like our auditing tasks. In the *Taboo* setting, we simply extract activations over the “Assistant” control token and ask the AO “What is the secret word?” (Figure 1). In contrast, applying many of the baseline techniques requires custom scaffolding or tuning.
2.  **Extreme generalization.** In all of our settings, AOs are trained on the original model, prior to fine-tuning. They nevertheless generalize to answering questions about activations from a fine-tuned model. In the emergent misalignment task, we even apply AOs as a [model diffing](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/crosscoders/index.html#model-diffing) technique, using them to explain the meaning of an activation *difference* between the fine-tuned and original model. Both of these require substantial generalization out of the AO’s training distribution.

Performance for white- and black-box methods is as reported in [Cywiński et al. (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01070). **Bottom:** The target prompt was given to the fine-tuned model and activations were extracted over all tokens. These activations were then injected as part of the oracle prompt for the AO.![](https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/bb914b9e35ce9ea31c63cb72d1f8bb47d865f8633ca5494a.png)**Figure 4. Top:** Performance on the emergent misalignment auditing task. On our rubric, 2/5 is a good score that indicates the auditor successfully identified the domain that the target model was fine-tuned on. ADL (Activation Difference Lens) is a technique introduced in [Minder et al. (2025)](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2510.13900) that makes use of multiple white-box affordances ([Patchscopes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06102), [logit lens](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AcKRB8wDpdaN6v6ru/interpreting-gpt-the-logit-lens), and steering). **Bottom:** We extracted an activation difference between the fine-tuned and original target model on the same prompt, then injected this difference vector into the oracle prompt.

**How does Activation Oracle training scale?**
----------------------------------------------

To understand what contributes to strong AO performance, we conduct a training data ablation study. This involves evaluating AOs trained on subsets of our full training set. We do this both for our secret-elicitation evaluation discussed above, as well as two simpler evaluations that we could easily run on four models (Qwen-3 8B, Gemma-2 9B, Llama-3.3 70B, and Claude Haiku 3.5).[^4hgq02yt7zw]

Overall, training on more tasks boosts AO performance. In our paper, we show that this is due both to increasing data *quantity* as well as data *diversity*. This is a promising sign for future development of AOs: It suggests that it is possible to make AOs better simply by scaling their training data.

**How do Activation Oracles relate to mechanistic approaches to interpretability?**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Activation Oracles are a fundamentally *non-mechanistic* technique for interpreting LLM activations. As such, there are many questions that they are not suited to answer, such as:

1.  **How is semantic meaning encoded in activations?** Are concepts encoded [linearly](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03658)? How do these concepts [compose](https://aclanthology.org/N13-1090.pdf)? What is the [geometry](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html) [of](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14860) [these](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/may-update/index.html#feature-manifolds) [representations](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/linebreaks/index.html)?
2.  **How do LLM computations process and transform these activations?** [What](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html) [algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05217) [are](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00593) [encoded](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/in-context-learning-and-induction-heads/index.html) [in](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05262) [LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04625) [weights](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/attribution-graphs/methods.html)?

Other, more mechanistic, methods are needed to address questions like these.

Even for their intended use-case—interpreting LLM activations—AOs have important limitations relative to prior methods:

1.  **AOs are not exhaustive**. They will not tell you everything you want to know about an activation, including answering questions that we don’t know to ask. In contrast, unsupervised feature disentanglement methods like sparse autoencoders (SAEs) can, at least in principle, provide an exhaustive decomposition and surface meaning that we don’t know to look for.
2.  **AOs** **might be too expressive.** Part of the appeal of lightweight methods like linear probes or SAEs is that they are more likely to only extract meaning from LLM representations when that meaning is already present. Concretely, consider the case of understanding [what an LLM believes about the user](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02469). It may be the case that the LLM has noticed various properties about the user, but has not assembled them into a prediction that the user is Irish. However, an [AO trained to predict user demographics](https://transluce.org/user-modeling) might learn to *itself* assemble this prediction, even though the target LLM has not done so. More generally, we need to worry that the explanations that we obtain from the AO more reflect the AO’s understanding, rather than the target LLM’s understanding. In the worst case, AOs might confabulate plausible guesses.
3.  **AOs are expensive at inference time.** To answer a single question about an activation, we must sample multiple tokens from an AO, requiring multiple forward passes; this is more expensive than it was to produce the target activation in the first place! In contrast, lightweight methods like linear probes or SAEs have negligible inference cost.

That said, we nevertheless believe that AOs hold promise for multiple reasons:

1.  **Scalability.** We find that AO performance scales with data quantity and diversity, suggesting it might be possible to improve AOs by simply producing more and higher-quality training data. AOs are a [bitter lesson](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~eunsol/courses/data/bitter_lesson.pdf)-compliant approach to interpreting activations.
2.  **Simplicity and form factor.** As discussed above, applying many other white-box techniques to our auditing tasks requires task-specific scaffolding and tuning. In contrast, interacting with an AO is almost as simple as querying an LLM chatbot, a familiar interface for many people; the only additional complexity is selecting which activations to pass to the AO for interpretation.
3.  **Expressivity.** While expressivity can carry challenges (as discussed above), it is also powerful. Instead of interpreting LLM activations in terms of a bag of concepts from a fixed concept set (as SAEs do when they decompose activations into features), AOs can articulate responses with the flexibility and expressivity of natural language.
4.  **Generalization.** Supervised probes are a *narrow* method: One needs to train a new probe per property, and probes cannot generalize to classify properties other than those they were trained to classify. In contrast, we hope that AOs can effectively serve as probes “on demand,” with the researcher only needing to write down a natural-language specification of the property they wish to probe for. Moreover, AOs have a chance of generalizing to answer questions for which we couldn’t realistically train supervised probes.

Overall, while AOs cannot answer every question in the field of interpretability (and might not always be the best tool for the questions they can answer), we are nevertheless excited about AOs as a complementary approach to interpretability. We are also excited about hybrid methods, such as applying AOs to interpret SAE error terms.

**Conclusion**
--------------

Activation Oracles are LLMs trained to flexibly accept LLM neural activations as inputs and answer questions about them. We train AOs on a diverse set of tasks, then evaluate their usefulness for out-of-distribution downstream tasks, finding strong performance. AO performance scales with data quantity and diversity.

**To learn more,** [**read our paper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15674)**.** 

[^5bobngkr1tt]: We extract activations from multiple layers of the target model. These activations are then injected in the layer 1 residual stream of the AO, even though this is not the layer that the activations were extracted from. The AO’s prompt specifies the layer number in the target model where the activations were extracted. 

[^q3f07rexvk]: The one task where AOs are not the best (or tied for best) method was “Secret Side Constraint,” a setting where black-box prompting techniques can induce the target model to reveal its secret knowledge. 

[^4hgq02yt7zw]: We do not perform our secret elicitation evaluations on all four models because they require an intensive step of fine-tuning the model to possess secret knowledge. However, we did replicate our Taboo evaluation on Qwen3-8B.
